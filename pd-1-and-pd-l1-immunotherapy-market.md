<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PD-1 and PD-L1 Immunotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PD-1 inhibitor</li><li>PD-L1 inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PD-1 and PD-L1 immunotherapy focuses on enhancing the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells. PD-1 inhibitors block the programmed cell death protein 1 receptor on T-cells, while PD-L1 inhibitors target the programmed death-ligand 1 protein on tumor cells. Both types aim to disrupt the inhibitory signals that cancer cells use to evade immune response, leading to increased T-cell activity against tumors. This market continues to grow, driven by advancements in cancer treatment options and ongoing research.</p></p>
