<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aerospace tire market primarily comprises two types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires feature cord plies arranged perpendicularly to the direction of travel, providing enhanced performance, fuel efficiency, and durability, making them suitable for modern aircraft. Bias tires, on the other hand, have plies arranged at an angle, offering a sturdier structure but with less flexibility and heat dissipation. While bias tires are often used in older aircraft and specific applications, radial tires are increasingly preferred in contemporary aviation for their superior characteristics.</p></p>
